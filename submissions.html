            Submissions should take a critical, reflexive stance, and also may provide an outlook on how to tackle a topic, such as a particular ethical or methodological challenge in an interdisciplinary setting.

            <p>Submissions may either be non-archival 2-page statements of interest or motivation, or archival papers up to 4,000 words. Accepted archival papers will be published in ICWSM Workshop Proceedings, a special issue of the journal Frontiers in Big Data. Open Access publishing fees will be waived for authors without institutions support for covering these fees.
            </p>
            <p>
            All submissions must be in English.

                <li>If you do not have institutional support for Open Access:</li>
