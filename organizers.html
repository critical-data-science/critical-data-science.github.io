          Dr. Momin M. Malik is the Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He holds a PhD in Societal Computing and a Master’s in Machine Learning from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the Oxford Internet Institute, and an undergraduate degree in history of science from Harvard University. He was a 2017 Data Science for Social Good fellow. His dissertation work attempts to lay out a research agenda for using modeling in critical and reflexive ways, as well as connect this agenda to relevant precedents and parallel projects. During his PhD, he was a facilitator for Bias Buster @ CMU, a program for inclusivity workshops based on materials from and made in collaboration with Google Pittsburgh. He helped manage logistics to run a “Train the Trainers” one-day workshop at Google Pittsburgh with an attendance of about 50, and also was part of 4-facilitator teams running Bias Busters Train the Trainers sessions at the Tapia and WEPAN conferences.

          Dr. Katja Mayer trained as a sociologist and works at the intersection of science-technology-society. She studies the interactions of social scientific method and its publics. Currently she is investigating open practices in Computational Social Science and Big Data for her habilitation project at the Department of Social Studies of Science and Technology at the University of Vienna. Until 2019, she was a postdoc at the School of Governance, Technical University Munich. She also works as a senior scientist at the Centre for Social Innovation in Vienna, serves as an expert for the European Commission, and is an associated researcher for the Responsible Research and Innovation in Academic Practice platform at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, she has been teaching sociology of knowledge, STS, and critical data studies since 2008 at various universities, and was a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science. She is core member of OANA (Open Access Network Austria) and co-leads the working group on defining a national strategy for the transition to Open Science. During 2011-2013, she was scientific advisor to the president of the European Research Council (ERC). She is co-editor of a forthcoming special issue on Critical Data Studies in Frontiers on Big Data.</br>

          Hemank Lamba is a PhD student in Societal Computing, and a Master’s student in Machine Learning at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, he was a Research Engineer at IBM Research Labs, New Delhi. His research is focused on the understanding and modeling the user behavior on social media - specifically characterizing the deviant user behavior on these platforms, and understanding the effects of such behavior on the society. He has also been a fellow with multiple Data Science for Social Good initiatives (University of Chicago and IBM Research), where he has tackled problems related to food insecurity in U.S. and understanding the ecospace of philanthropic projects. In his time at Pittsburgh, he was a board member for the student organization Students for Urban Data Systems (SUDS), facilitating student projects on non-profit organizations and city’s open data. Hemank holds a B.Tech in Computer Science from IIIT-Delhi, India.

          Prof. Dr. Claudia Müller-Birn is the head of the research group Human-Centered Computing (HCC.lab) at the Institute of Computer Science at the Freie Universität Berlin. Before her appointment at FU Berlin, she undertook a post-doc at the Carnegie Mellon University, based on a Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation. Her interdisciplinary research advances the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Social Computing. Her research entails both an empirical and an engineering dimension. One objective is to contribute to a value-based socio-technical systems design that fulfills the specific needs of an application area, such as in ideation, and visualization. Besides, Claudia advocates the use and development of open source software, the principles of open science in her research work, and the open access to scholarly knowledge. She served as (co)chair of a number of conferences such as ACM OpenSym.</br>
